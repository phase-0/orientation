# Use of the space

While Phase 0 is a remote phase, Phase 0 students are welcome to use the space during office hours (9am - 5.30pm). We have a limited number of desks free, and you will need to bring your own laptop.


## What support is available at Dev Academy?

We want to be as helpful as possible, which is why we have opened up our space to students studying remotely. However our teachers are dedicated to Bootcamp students, and are therefore unable to assist Phase 0 students. There will be coaches available at times, but you will need to communicate with them on slack to check their availability. In other words, please don't assume that because you can see a coach in the room, that it is ok to approach that coach and ask them for help. Phase 0 is predominately a self-directed preparation phase, and our teachers are dedicated to bootcamp students. 


## Appropriate use of the space

- Keep the desk area clean.
- Don't leave personal items at a desk
- Do your dishes!
- Leave the space better than you found it.
- When possible, return furniture to where it was set when you entered the space, and clean the space even if you did not create the mess.
- Slack message a coach to ask for help. If the coach is free, they will come find you in the space.
